// CI deploy role, permissions boundary and IAM path of every role this app creates
// (docs/build-plan.md WP-02 and WP-03, ADR-0009, docs/architecture.md §1 and §14).
//
// The deploy role is the one resource that must exist before the first `sst deploy`: GitHub
// Actions assumes it through OIDC (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to deploy `poc`, so SST cannot
// create it. It is born from infra/bootstrap/ci-role.yaml, a CloudFormation template the operator
// applies once per account (docs/architecture.md §15 step 2). That template also creates the
// permissions boundary `<app>-ci-boundary` and the `qa-runner` role of the scenario runner.
//
// This module creates nothing. It pins the names both sides share and makes SST put every
// `aws.iam.Role` and `aws.iam.Policy` of the app
//
//   - under the IAM path `/<app>/`: the demos account is shared with other projects, and the path
//     is what fences IAM for the deploy role (create, edit, pass and delete only under it). A path
//     is part of the ARN and cannot be changed or forged after creation, unlike a tag;
//   - behind the permissions boundary: the deploy role may only `iam:CreateRole` with it, and may
//     only edit the policies of a role that still carries it. The boundary limits every role to
//     resources of this app (tag `sst:app`, or name where tags cannot fence), one region, no IAM
//     management and no role assumption, whatever policy a commit attaches to it.
//
// `$transform` reaches only resources constructed after it is registered, so sst.config.ts imports
// this module right after tags and before any module that creates a role. A module must never set
// its own `path` or `permissionsBoundary`: the deploy role would be denied the creation.
//
// Trust of the deploy role: `sub` of a push to the deploy branch, in the two shapes GitHub emits
// (by name, and `repo:<org>@<orgId>/<repo>@<repoId>:...` for repositories created after
// 2026-07-15), always together with the numeric `repository_id` and `repository_owner_id` claims
// and the `job_workflow_ref` of deploy.yml on main. The deploy job declares no `environment:` on
// purpose: GitHub would then emit `sub = repo:<org>/<repo>:environment:<name>` and the trust by
// branch would not match. Never loosen the trust with a wildcard in `sub`.
//
// The GitHub OIDC provider (token.actions.githubusercontent.com) is account-wide, one per URL, and
// already exists in the demos account shared by other projects: the app references it and the
// deploy role is denied creating, changing or deleting it.
//
// CloudFront parts cannot be tagged, so the deploy role is fenced to them by name or by ARN
// (infra/ci-spec.ts): this module also names every CloudFront function `<app>-<stage>-<logical>`.
//
// Verify: `aws --profile craftech-demos iam get-role --role-name <CI_DEPLOY_ROLE_NAME>` ·
// `aws --profile craftech-demos iam get-policy --policy-arn <ciBoundaryArn>` ·
// `aws --profile craftech-demos iam list-roles --path-prefix /<app>/` lists every role of the app,
// each one with `PermissionsBoundary` · `aws --profile craftech-demos cloudfront list-functions`
// shows the functions of the app under `<app>-<stage>-`.
